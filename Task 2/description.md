web scrapping.     
How can we scrape a site using beautifulsoup, requests etc.    
Also, how can we integrate LLM to scrape websites.    
Try to implement both practically and document it.    
Documentation should contain the architecture, the approach you followed, workflow and the libraries, LLMs you have used (GPT, Gemini, Deepseek, Llama etc.).    
Also, research about some open-source LLM based web scrapper if available.     
You have to try it practically and analyse which method is more effective. The pros and cons for both the approaches, then we will discuss which method we need to implement.
