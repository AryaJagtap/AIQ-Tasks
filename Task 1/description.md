Tasks for R&D:
 
What is LLM. How they work.
 
What are AI Agents and their working principle.
Difference between AI Agents and Agentic AI.
What is RAG, the architecture, working fundamentals (Most important)
Vector embeddings and how they work (dimensionality, similarity metrics, cosine distance)
Difference between semantic search and keyword search
Vector databases (Pinecone, FAISS, ChromaDB)

How embedding models generate meaningful representations of text
Embedding models (text-embedding-3-small vs. text-embedding-3-large)
Open-source embeddings (sentence-transformers, all-MiniLM)
LangChain for LLM orchestration
LangGraph, LangSmith, CrewAI
 
Building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Context window and it's management
Handling hallucinations and validation
 
Explore about Docker containerization
Explore about open-source LLMs like Llama, Deepseek, Gemma etc.
How to access these models using APIs (GroqCloud, Huggingface etc.)
 
 
Please go through these concepts.
